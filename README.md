# algorithms
implementations of standard data types and algorithms in Ruby, JavaScript, and C

## Dynamic Array
implements a dynamic array class on top a simulated static "C" array class as a linear array with O(n) shift/unshift and as a ring buffer with amortized O(1) shift/unshift.

## HashMap, Linked List, and LRU cache
building up data structures from simpler one in stages using simple hashing functions in Ruby,
doubly-linked list also in C.

## Quicksort
out-of-place and in-place implementations of Quicksort with random pivot

## JavaScript Algorithms
JavaScript implementations of Mergesort, Bubblesort, Quicksort, and Binary Search

## Binary Search Tree
a simple Ruby implementation of a binary search tree using Hibbard deletion

## Heap
first implementation of a Binary Min Heap (without index map) and Heapsort

## Graphs
Adjacency List representation of a graph and Kahn's and Tarjan's topological sorting algorithms;
second implementation of a Binary Min Heap (with index map), Priority Map, Dijkstra shortest path
